# Click-Through Rate Prediction and Online Advertising Analysis

Unlock the secrets of online ad success! Predict user engagement, optimize ad placements, and master Click-Through Rate (CTR) with data-driven insights.

Welcome to our Click-Through Rate Prediction project! In the dynamic realm of online advertising, data-driven decision-making is essential. This project explores CTR prediction, aiming to unveil the factors influencing audience engagement.

## Project Objective
Our primary goal is to develop and recommend a machine learning model for predicting ad clicks. This involves selecting the appropriate methods and assessing associated risks.

## Data Dictionary
Here's a data dictionary for the key columns in our dataset:

| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| click            | Binary indicator (0/1) for non-click/click               |
| hour             | Timestamp in YYMMDDHH format, e.g., 14091123 for 23:00 on Sept. 11, 2014 UTC |
| C1               | Anonymized categorical variable                          |
| banner_pos       | Position of the ad/banner on the page                   |
| site_id          | Unique ID of the site displaying the ad                |
| site_domain      | Unique domain of the site displaying the ad            |
| site_category    | Category of the site displaying the ad                 |
| app_id           | App ID of the site displaying the ad                    |
| app_domain       | App category of the site displaying the ad            |
| app_category     | Category ID of the site displaying the ad              |
| device_id        | Device ID on which the ad was displayed                |
| device_ip        | IP address of the device where the ad was displayed     |
| device_model     | Model type of the device where the ad was displayed     |
| device_type      | Type of device where the ad was displayed               |
| device_conn_type | Connection type of the device where the ad was displayed |
| C14 - C21        | Anonymized categorical variables                         |

## Project Overview
Most websites feature ads, but how do you decide which ad to display, to whom, and where? Our project confronts these challenges. We've analyzed a dataset comprising nearly 100,000 records, exploring various classification methods to predict user clicks on ads.

## Key Highlights
- Immerse yourself in the world of CTR prediction and data-driven advertising.
- Learn how to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.
- Discover the effectiveness of three classification methods in addressing real-world business challenges.
- Evaluate models using industry-standard metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC curves.
- Gain insights into model interpretability and its implications for business decisions.
- Prepare to make informed choices with enhanced model predictability.
